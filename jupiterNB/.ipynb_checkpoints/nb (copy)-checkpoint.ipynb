    "People opnions might vary on the matter of them liking to travel around. Some like to travel at every oppurtunity, some like to travel occasionally, whereas others might not like to travel at all. Regardless, the one thing that they might all agree on is that travelling can get real expensive real fast. The cost of transportation, gas, food, tours, travel kits etc. However, one factor that is really influential is the amount of money you are spending on lodging. The amount you spend on lodging determines how much you can spend on every other thing like the food you can eat or explore, the places you can visit, the experience you can be part of and basically the memories you might make. \n",
